# markdown2man
NOT WORKING YET !!!!!!!


A GitHub Action to convert a markdown document into a man page.

## Inputs

**Required:**
* markdown_file: Markdown file pathname to convert, relative to repository root.
* manpage_name: Man page name for converted document.

**Optional:**
* manpage_section: Section for converted man page. Defaults to "1".
* manpage_folder: Output folder for converted man page. Defaults to the same 
folder as markdown_file.
* manpage_title: Title for converted manpage. Defaults to "Usage documentation".

## Example usage

```
 uses: dante-signal31/markdown2man@main
    with:
        markdown_file: src/tests/resources/README.md
        manpage_name: cifra
        manpage_section: 2
        manpage_folder: man/
```

With that configuration a man file called cifra.2.gz should be created at man folder.
If manpage_folder does not exist then markdown2man creates it for you.
